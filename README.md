# Recipe-Recommendation-assignment.-
Hello and welcome to the Recipe Recommendation assignment. 

 

If you visit any recipe websites, let’s say food.com, for example, you will notice a section called “You’ll also love.” Under this section, the website recommends recipes related to the one you are looking at or based on your past rating patterns. 


The end objective of this entire assignment is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and feature extraction from the raw data. 

For this case study, you will need to use Spark on Elastic Map Reduce service (EMR). 

We recommend that you use a master node with m4.xlarge and 1 cluster node with m4.large configuration. This cluster should give you sufficient processing power to work with this data. 

Note: Terminate your cluster when not in use.
